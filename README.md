# MIPI-DSI-
The MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) is commonly used for high-speed communication between processors and display modules.  It is crucial for integrating SoCs (System on Chip) with mobile displays in devices like smartphones, tablets, automotive displays, and wearable gadgets. MIPI DSI is a high-speed differential serial interface used for transmitting pixel data and control information from a host (e.g., GPU/SoC) to a display.
